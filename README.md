[![Neovim >= 0.8](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neovim-%3E%3D%200.8-blueviolet.svg?style=flat-square)](https://neovim.io/)

A Neovim plugin to fetch and display Salesforce Apex code coverage directly within the editor. It utilizes the `sf` CLI to query coverage data and visualizes it using Neovim's sign column.

## ✨ Features

*   Fetches Apex code coverage data using the Salesforce CLI (`sf`).
*   Displays total aggregated coverage for a class/trigger.
*   Displays coverage specific to individual test methods.
*   Visualizes covered and uncovered lines using signs.
*   Provides an option to refresh coverage data. 
*   Configurable key mappings.

## 📋 Requirements

*   [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) >= 0.8
*   [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)
*   [Salesforce CLI (`sf`)](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli) installed and authenticated to a target org.

## 📦 Installation

Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
-- Add to your lazy.nvim plugin configuration
return {
    "PreziosiRaffaele/nvim-apex-coverage",
    dependencies = { "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim" },
    -- Optional: Lazy load on Apex file types for faster startup
    ft = { "apex", "apexclass", "trigger" }, -- Adjust filetypes as needed
    opts = {
      -- Configuration options (see below)
      -- mappings = {
      --   coverage = '<leader>tc', -- Example custom mapping
      --   clean = '<leader>tC',    -- Example custom mapping
      -- }
    },
    config = true, 
}
```

**Note:** After installation, run `:helptags ALL` in Neovim to make the documentation (`:help apex-coverage`) available.

## 🚀 Usage

1.  Open an Apex class (`.cls`) or trigger (`.trigger`) file in Neovim.
2.  Run the `:ApexCoverage` command or use the default mapping `<leader>tc`.
3.  A selection menu will appear:
    *   **Total Coverage:** Shows aggregated coverage for the entire file.
    *   **[TestClass.TestMethod] - XX.XX%:** Shows coverage specific to that test method.
    *   **Refresh Data:** Fetches the latest coverage data from Salesforce.
4.  Select an option to visualize the coverage:
    *   Covered lines will be marked with a sign (default: `▎` with `DiffAdd` highlight).
    *   Uncovered lines will be marked with a sign (default: `▎` with `DiffDelete` highlight).
5.  To clear the coverage signs, run the `:ApexCoverageClean` command or use the default mapping `<leader>tC`.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configure the plugin by passing options to the `setup()` function. When using `lazy.nvim`, place your configuration within the `opts = { ... }` table as shown in the installation example.

**Default Configuration:**

```lua
require('apex-coverage').setup({
  mappings = {
    coverage = '<leader>tc', -- Mapping to show coverage selection menu
    clean = '<leader>tC',    -- Mapping to clear coverage signs
  }
})
```

**Available Options:**

*   `mappings` (`table`): Override the default key mappings.
    *   `coverage` (`string`): Keymap for the `:ApexCoverage` command.
    *   `clean` (`string`): Keymap for the `:ApexCoverageClean` command.

## ⌨️ Commands

*   `:ApexCoverage`: Fetches coverage data (if not cached) for the current Apex file and displays the selection menu to visualize coverage.
*   `:ApexCoverageClean`: Removes all coverage signs placed by this plugin from the current buffer.

## 🗺️ Mappings

Default mappings (can be changed via configuration):

*   `<leader>tc`: Calls `:ApexCoverage` in normal mode.
*   `<leader>tC`: Calls `:ApexCoverageClean` in normal mode.

## 🎯 Scope & Related Plugins

This plugin is specifically designed to **fetch and visualize Apex code coverage**. It does not include functionality for running Apex tests or other general interactions with the Salesforce CLI.
